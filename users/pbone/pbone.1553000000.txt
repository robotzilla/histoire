1553225640 #jsapi More work on Bug 1470369 - it's not possible to statically know if a cell might be nursery allocated, so I can't statically ensure that hash table sweeping is safe.  And updating the barriers isn't safe either because they're called off-thread during sweeping.  We just have to do our best with not compacting these tables during off-thread sweeping.
