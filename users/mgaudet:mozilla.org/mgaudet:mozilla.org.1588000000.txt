1588021838 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Resuscitated some of the private fields code that had already been written; an extremely basic test case appears to work as if the code were using public fields... which is totally progress!
1588111816 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Spent the day reading André's already in-progress stack for implementing private fields. (@anba++) Tomorrow will probably continue down that road, and re-teach myself all sorts of things about how this engine works that I've forgotten or need to learn.
1588260105 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Today I learned that if a base class constructor returns an object, that's the value returned by `new C`, not a newly created object. Yet, if a derived class constructor does the same, the same is not true. (Haven't -quite- pieced together all the spec text yet); this is the root of how fields can get stamped into random objects.
