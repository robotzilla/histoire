1589320018 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Mostly finished some patches for stencil, snapshotting information from the scope chain before parse.

1589492229 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Sometimes the best way to figure out how to do something is to just start... so you can figure out why your first pass is wrong. Much learning today, and a little code thrown out for good measure

1589924642 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Have a preliminary patch which adds interpreter support for initializing, reading and writing private fields on classes (with the appropriate type errors thrown) using new opcodes. Working on ensuring baseline / blinterp work properly.
