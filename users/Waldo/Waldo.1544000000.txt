1544576426 #jsapi made JSM/component loading mandate UTF-8 encoding
1544576447 #jsapi made .sjs scripts have to be UTF-8-encoded
1544576534 #jsapi very very very nearly finished auditing all callers of loadSubScript, changing the ones passed only ASCII to use a new runUtf8Script, and adjusting the ones currently passed UTF-8 that's really interpreted as Latin-1 so that they will be correct when loaded as UTF-8
1544576594 #jsapi landed most of accurate column-tracking code, save for the final bit to actually enable it -- because some devtools tests leak windows with the final bit in place (and do not appear to hit any other failures in the process)
