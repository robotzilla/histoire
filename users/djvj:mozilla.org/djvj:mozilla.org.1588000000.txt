1588022121 #spidermonkey:mozilla.org Went back to rejig earlier parser-atoms patches to move parser atoms table from TokenStreamCharsBase to TokenStreamAnyChars, then realized that it needs to be accessed from both places.  Then started looking at actual contentful uses of atoms from code in both inheritance hierarchies to see which made more sense.
