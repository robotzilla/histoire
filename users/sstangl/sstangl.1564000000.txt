1564002645 #jsapi Reviewed a bunch of patches from Nicolas. Validated hopefully final cranelift-wasm BB patch; submitted as https://github.com/CraneStation/cranelift/pull/867. Built SpiderMonkey with all our Cranelift patches: jit-tests pass now with basic-blocks enabled! https://github.com/CraneStation/cranelift/pull/844#issuecomment-514800239.
1564090822 #jsapi Landed patch: cranelift-wasm is now basic-blocks friendly! Still reading through nbp's regalloc patch.
1564175606 #jsapi Read through nbp's regalloc patch and a whole slew of regalloc code. Investigated codegen issues with basic blocks. Filed https://github.com/CraneStation/cranelift/issues/873, simple and symptomatic of weird codegen. Started planning the cranelift.org design.
1564423089 #jsapi Meetings. My desktop finally arrived from CA (shipped by Mozilla) -- it was completely destroyed in-transit. The monitor is in pieces, and the desktop case is broken. I can't boot it, but I assume the innards are dead. Documented the damage.
1564609604 #jsapi Made a start on threading jumps as part of the relaxation pass.
1564694512 #jsapi Got fold_redundant_jumps() passing tests. Uploaded a WIP patch: https://github.com/CraneStation/cranelift/pull/887. More to be done tomorrow -- more opportunities for folding, and need to validate that ebb parameters don't need special treatment post-regalloc.
