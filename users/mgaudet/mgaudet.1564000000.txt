1564000769 #jsapi Refactored flags out of JSFunction to a separate class to allow recycling flag only queries for deferred allocation of JSFunction. Patch needs some naming work, and perhaps a little bit of cleanup, but works!
1564002921 #jsapi So confused by my compiler errors that I'm putting down the keyboard and walking away; G'night everyone.
1564078749 #jsapi First successful run of a subset of test cases with deferred function allocation.
1564171450 #jsapi a slightly messy stack of patches now successfully defers JSFunction allocation to after parsing (in all cases except AsmJS). Cleanup and further testing are next on the roster

1564416445 #jsapi slogging through a rebase and making sure all patches are formatted, running into wild errors :(
1564435581 #jsapi Updated and uploaded patches for deferred GC thing allocation in parsing.
1564445063 #jsapi Starting to get really annoyed that my local mach clang-format and whatever the heck reviewbot run don't seem to agree on my patches.  😤
