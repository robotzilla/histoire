    This is a simple mechanism for recording timestamped messages. Add a message by saying "confession: &lt;whatever&gt;" in an IRC channel that contains the 'confession' bot. All messages are stored in <a href="https://github.com/mrgiggles/histoire">https://github.com/mrgiggles/histoire</a>. Note that this message store, and the whole mechanism, is 100% completely public.
      <p>
        If you wish to modify any existing messages, you can <a href='https://github.com/mrgiggles/histoire/tree/master/users/sfink'>submit a PR</a> to the github repository. Currently, you will also need to ping sfink on IRC or email sfink@mozilla.com to have updates merged, but I plan to enable one of the many auto-merge bots to just blindly accept anything (once I figure out which one to use.) The IRC bot uses a special append-only merge driver, so hopefully will not get conflicts unless you delete files or something.

        Feel free to file issues on the github repo. mrgiggles will feel free to ignore them. At some point I'll figure out how to forward his mail to me so I can see them.
