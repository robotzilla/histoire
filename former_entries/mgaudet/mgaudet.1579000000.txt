1579194006 #jsapi Took a break from other things to do a quick mini-exploration of Bug 1609487; unfortunately the easy knob isn't available so will probably stop here for now.
1579219702 #jsapi trying to be ambitious without making totally unreviewable mega patches. Working on getting a clear story for bytecode emitter not having a script
1579281110 #jsapi Turns out I was measuring BCE the whole time, but BCE is appreciably faster than I had expected, and so was way lower in the profiles than I figured.
1579305607 #jsapi While chasing deferred JSScript decided best to rip out eager allocation mode first to make reasoning clear. Patches in prep, hopefully up for review by monday.
1579546671 #jsapi shakes fist at asm.js
1579627356 #jsapi trying and failing to land a stack. Hopefully I can get lando to cooperate in the not too distant future
1579651018 #jsapi Off kilter day. Investigating and thinking about killing BytecodeCompiler. Seems... plausible? Not sure if there are deep dark corners that will make me full of regret, but need more time with it.
1579824281 #jsapi Palpably within reach of removing BytecodeCompiler... but I should stop for the day today
