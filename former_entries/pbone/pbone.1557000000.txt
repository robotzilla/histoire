1557380686 #jsapi Doing initial reading and checking to figure out how to improve our decommiting code.  I want to make it a little more general but also ensure that it doesn't interrupt a busy process.
1557406812 #jsapi I have an interesting idea and will tell you once the try build finishes ;-)
1557463342 #jsapi My good idea looks quite good (according to perfherder) and I filed Bug 1550660 to follow through with it.
